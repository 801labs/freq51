### âœ… Choosing the Right Software  
- **Mobile**: If you're handheld or portable, use the official Android or iOS app.  
- **Desktop / Browser**: For laptop/desktop access, the Web Client offers a full experience.  
- **Embedded Device**: Use MUI when you want a dedicated node with built-in UI.  
- **Automation / Server**: For telemetry, scripts or server-side work, go with the Python CLI.  
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: For larger node deployments or network health, use one of the community tools (MeshView, MeshSense, MeshMonitor, Malla).  
- **Outdoor or group ops**: Check Kiba Outdoors for a mobile-centric outdoor-friendly app.
