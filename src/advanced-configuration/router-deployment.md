## üè∑Ô∏è Understanding Router Roles

### üîÑ ROUTER Role
- **Purpose**: Optimized for message forwarding and network infrastructure
- **Behavior**: Stores messages longer, prioritizes routing over local communication
- **Power**: Requires reliable, continuous power source
- **Coverage**: Should provide strategic coverage for the network
- **Coordination**: **MANDATORY** community approval required

### üö´ REPEATER Role
- **‚ùå NOT RECOMMENDED**: Should be avoided by all users
- **Why avoid**: Can cause network congestion and interference
- **Community policy**: Only deployed by experienced members with specific approval
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical**: Never use without explicit network coordinator permission

## üìè Strategic Placement by Elevation

Where we place routers is very important.

### üèîÔ∏è High Elevation Backbone Routers (~9,361' - Nelson Peak Level)

**Purpose**: Major backbone infrastructure for maximum regional coverage

**Characteristics**:
- **Elevation**: 9,000+ feet above sea level
- **Coverage**: 50+ miles with clear line-of-sight
- **Role**: Primary ROUTER role only
- **Power**: Must have reliable, continuous power (solar + battery backup recommended)
- **Antenna**: High-gain directional and omnidirectional antennas
- **Coordination**: Requires extensive community planning and approval

**Example Locations**:
- Mountain peaks and ridges
- Tall communication towers
- Strategic high points with 360¬∞ visibility
- Existing radio infrastructure sites

**Requirements**:
- Community approval and coordination
- Reliable power infrastructure
- Weather-resistant housing
- Remote monitoring capabilities
- Regular maintenance access

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Regional Coverage Routers (~5,600' - Point of the Mountain Level)

**Purpose**: Regional coverage bridging high backbone to local nodes

**Characteristics**:
- **Elevation**: 5,000-7,000 feet above sea level
- **Coverage**: 15-30 mile radius depending on terrain
- **Role**: ROUTER or ROUTER_CLIENT for secondary infrastructure
- **Power**: Reliable power source (grid-tied or robust solar)
- **Antenna**: Medium to high-gain antennas
- **Coordination**: Community coordination recommended

**Example Locations**:
- Foothills and elevated neighborhoods
- Radio towers and communication sites
- Elevated commercial/residential buildings
- Strategic overlooks and ridges

**Requirements**:
- Community notification and approval
- Stable power source
- Weather protection
- Basic monitoring capabilities

### üè† Local/Ground Level (25-35' - House Roofs/Ground Level)

**Purpose**: Local mesh participation and user access

**Characteristics**:
- **Elevation**: Ground level to 100 feet
- **Coverage**: 1-5 miles in typical terrain
- **Role**: CLIENT or CLIENT_MUTE (NOT router roles)
- **Why CLIENT**: Prevents network congestion from too many routers
- **Power**: Standard residential power

**Example Locations**:
- Home installations
- Portable setups
- Vehicle mounts
- Temporary deployments

**Key Principle**: Higher elevation = greater responsibility and coordination requirements. Most users should remain clients regardless of their installation height.
