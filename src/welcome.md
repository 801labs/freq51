# Freq51

Welcome to the local Utah Mesh. We are working to build a more coordinated mesh than the standard Frequency 20.

What does this mean? To have a health mesh, here are the standards we are trying to keep:
- *No Routers* unless you coordinate with the local community. See [Router Deployment Guide](router-deployment.md).
- Static outdoor nodes should be client
- Moblie nodes should be client_mute unless you have a specific usecase
- Keep a way for us to contact you in case your node starts making too much noise
