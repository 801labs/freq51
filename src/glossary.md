## A
- App / Application / Client Application — An application that connects to a Meshtastic node to send and receive messages via the mesh. See also: Client.

## F

- Flash / Flashing — Installing or updating firmware on a device.
- Freq51 — Community coordination around stable deployments, recommended settings, and onboarding for a healthy mesh.

## G
- Gateway — A node that bridges the mesh to external systems (often via MQTT). Requires careful configuration to avoid loops and flooding.
- GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) — Digital I/O pins for sensors, buttons, etc.
- GPS — Global Positioning System; nodes can report position as telemetry.

## H
- Hop — A relay through another node.
- Hop Limit — The maximum number of hops a packet may traverse; helps control congestion and airtime.
- Hidden Client — See Role (CLIENT_HIDDEN).

## I
- ID (Node ID / Long Name / Short Name) — Identifiers for a node in the mesh and UI.
- Interval (Telemetry/Position) — Frequency at which telemetry or position is sent; balance visibility with airtime usage.

## J
- — (No common entry)

## K
- Key (Channel Key) — See PSK (Pre‑Shared Key).

## L
- LoRa — Low‑power, long‑range radio used by Meshtastic.
- LoS (Line of Sight) — A clear, unobstructed RF path through air; best link quality typically requires LoS.
- Lost and Found — See Role (LOST_AND_FOUND).

## M
- Mesh Network — Decentralized network where nodes can forward messages for others.
- Modem Preset — Bundled LoRa parameters (Bandwidth, Spreading Factor, Coding Rate). All nodes must match to communicate.

### Modem Presets (summary)
- SHORT_TURBO — Highest bandwidth, shortest range.
- SHORT_FAST — High speed; short range.
- SHORT_SLOW — Moderate range; fairly high speed.
- MEDIUM_FAST — Balanced speed/range.
- MEDIUM_SLOW — More range; less speed.
- LONG_FAST — Default; long range, reasonable speed.
- LONG_MODERATE — More range/airtime; slower than LONG_FAST.
- LONG_SLOW — Very high link budget; very slow data rate.
- VERY_LONG_SLOW — Slowest; very high range; high airtime.

Note: As a general community default, use LONG_FAST unless coordinated otherwise.

- MQTT / MQTT Bridge — Protocol and bridge commonly used to link the mesh to servers/services. Configure topics, filters, and rebroadcast logic carefully to prevent loops.

## N
- Node — A device on the mesh that can send, receive, and relay messages.

## O
- OTA (Over‑the‑Air) — Wireless firmware update capability (device/platform dependent).

## P
- Packet — A unit of data sent over the mesh.
- PKC (Public Key Cryptography) — Used for direct, end‑to‑end messages with keypairs.
- Preset — See Modem Preset.
- Protobuf — Google’s serialization format used by Meshtastic protocols.
- PSK (Pre‑Shared Key) — Channel encryption key. All nodes on a channel must share the PSK to exchange messages.

## Q
- Quiet Client (Muted Client) — Client variant limiting rebroadcast/chat behavior to conserve airtime. See Role (CLIENT_MUTE).

## R
- Rebroadcast — Relaying a received packet. Behavior is controlled to minimize duplicates and loops. See: Rebroadcast Logic.
- Rebroadcast Logic — Rules/filters that determine whether and how messages are relayed (including deduplication). Critical when bridging (e.g., MQTT).
- Region — Regulatory domain determining allowed frequency band and power. See: Band.
- Repeater — Coverage‑extending node that is not shown in the standard node list.
- Role (Device Role) — The behavior mode of a node on the mesh. See the overview below.

### Device Roles (overview)
- CLIENT — Standard user node for sending/receiving messages.
- CLIENT_MUTE — Client with reduced chat/rebroadcast behavior to conserve airtime.

## T

## V
