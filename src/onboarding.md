# Freq51 Onboarding Guide - Welcome to the Intermountain Mesh!

## üéØ Quick Start - Get Connected in 15 Minutes

Welcome to Freq51! This guide will get you up and running on our Meshtastic network.

### What You'll Need

- **Hardware**: Any [Meshtastic-compatible device](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/)
- **App**: Meshtastic mobile app (iOS/Android) or web client
- **Time**: 15-30 minutes for initial setup
- **Location**: Salt Lake City, Utah region for best coverage

---

## üì± Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Hardware Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Get your device**: We recommend starting with a RAK device, Seeed Tracker, Station G2, XIAO, or Raspberry Pi-based device from the [supported hardware list](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/)
2. **Power on**: Some devices will create a WiFi hotspot on first boot

### 2. Connect via Meshtastic App (10 minutes)

1. **Download**: Get the official Meshtastic app from your app store
2. **Connect**: 
   - **Bluetooth**: Most devices connect via Bluetooth (recommended method)
   - **WiFi**: Some devices also support WiFi hotspot connection for web interface
3. **Initial setup**: Follow the in-app setup wizard

### 3. Configure for Freq51 (5 minutes)

Apply these **essential settings** for optimal network participation:

#### Channel Settings
- **Primary Channel**: Use default "LongFast" initially
- **Region**: Set to "US"
- **Frequency**: 915MHz band (automatic for US region)

#### Node Configuration
- **Node Name**: Choose something identifiable (avoid personal info)
- **Role**: Start with "CLIENT" (see roles section below)
- **Location**: Enable GPS if comfortable

#### Freq51-Specific Settings
- **MQTT**: Disable downlink

## üè∑Ô∏è Node Roles - Choose the Right One

Understanding roles is crucial for network health:

### üë§ CLIENT (Recommended for most users)
- **Best for**: Handheld devices, mobile setups, most users
- **Behavior**: General-purpose node that rebroadcasts packets only if no other node has already done so
- **Visibility**: Visible in nodes list/topology
- **Use when**: This is the default/normal choice

### üîá CLIENT_MUTE (Extra/local nodes)
- **Best for**: Additional handheld devices near better-placed nodes, Car-mounted devices, temporary deployments
- **Behavior**: Like CLIENT but does NOT forward other devices' packets at all (no repeating/routing)
- **Visibility**: Visible in nodes list
- **Use when**: You have extra handheld/indoor nodes near a better-placed node and want to avoid adding needless rebroadcasts. This is particularly useful with indoor nodes.

### üîÑ ROUTER (Infrastructure - Advanced users only!)
- **Best for**: Strategically placed infrastructure (mountain/very tall tower with big line-of-sight)
- **Behavior**: Always rebroadcasts each packet once and is prioritized for routing ("cuts in line" vs other roles)
- **Visibility**: Visible in nodes list/topology
- **Use when**: Device is strategically placed to extend coverage for many others
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Misplacing routers increases collisions and wastes hops. Contact the [Discord community] before deploying
- **üìñ Detailed Guide**: See our comprehensive [Router Deployment Guide](advanced-configuration/router-deployment.md) before **considering setting up a router**.

### üîÑ ROUTER_LATE (Infrastructure - Advanced users only!)
- **Best for**: Adding reliability/coverage for local clusters without stealing priority
- **Behavior**: Always rebroadcasts once, but only after all other modes have had their chance (not prioritized)
- **Visibility**: Visible in nodes list/topology
- **Use when**: You need a "safety net" for a small area or dead spots without stealing routing priority from better infrastructure

### üö´ REPEATER (**Not Used** - Advanced users only!)
- **Best for**: Pure extenders in strategic spots
- **Behavior**: Always rebroadcasts each packet once with minimal overhead, turns off its own broadcast chatter
- **Visibility**: NOT visible in nodes list/topology
- **Special**: Only role that can use ALL_SKIP_DECODING rebroadcast mode
- **Use when**: You want a pure extender in a strategic spot and don't need the node itself to appear in topology
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This mode can cause serious issues with the mesh and it's particularly hard to troubleshoot. Contact the [Discord community] before deploying repeaters
- **üìñ Detailed Guide**: See our comprehensive [Router Deployment Guide](advanced-configuration/router-deployment.md) for complete information

## ‚ùì Quick Troubleshooting

### Can't see other nodes?
- Check region settings (must be "US")
- Verify antenna connections
- Try different locations (higher elevation helps)
- Ensure role is CLIENT
 - Location broadcasts are intentionally infrequent to reduce RF noise; it can take several hours for nodes to appear on your map

### Messages not getting through?
- Check [router placements](infrastructure.md) and see if you're near the mesh
- Network may be busy - try again later
- Check hop limit (default 3 is usually good)
- Verify channel settings match community standards
